    Optimise with - settings

inlinings (n : Int)
    Global inlinings, during optimisation at most n inlinings will be made.
    Default: infinite (represented by a negative number)

noinlinings
    No functions are inlined unless explicitly stated.
    Alias for inlinings 0
    Default: off
    Suggestion: This does not affect primitive functions.

inline (f : Function) [n : Int]
    Inline the function f, at most n times, or infinite times if n is 
    unspecified, without affecting the global inlining count. 
    This can be useful to restrict the amount of unrolling 
    for a function, or to toggle inlining on for a function if inlining
    is turned off.

noinline (f : Function)
    Do not inline function f.
    Alias for inline f 0.

casebranches
    Optimise case branches. Breaks semantics.
    Default: off


Examples:
    
    applyOnList xs = optimise \f. map f xs with
                        { inline map (length xs) };
                        
    filterShortList p xs = optimise filter p xs with 
                        { inline filter 10
                        ; casebranches
                        };
                       
    optNo f n = optimize f with { noinline f
                                ; casebranches
                                ; inlinings n
                                }

    onlyOpt f n = optimize f with { noinlinings
                                  ; inline f n 
                                  };
